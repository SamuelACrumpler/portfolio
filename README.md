# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the deployment version of the app. With server functionality.\
If you would like to run this with server functionality, you will need to create a MongoDB Atlas account and change the login information found in the server/index.js location.

### `npm run frontend`

Runs the development build of the frontend. This can be run right away due to not using anything server side.

### `npm run backend`

Runs backend for development. Used when creating the functionality for the server side features.
